<h2>Project Discription</h2>
Districting and Gerrymandering have been in the news a lot recently, and the mathematical modeling of how to draw districts is a very hot topic. This project will look at the space of all possible redistrictings of a state to see whether the current plan is an outlier. It will involve probability and computing skills.

<h2>Time Line</h2>

* First meeting: January 4
* Mid-quarter meeting: February 1
* Final meeting: March 1
